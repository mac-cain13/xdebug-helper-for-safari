XDebug Helper for Safari
========================

Debugging, profiling and tracing PHP code with [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) is very powerful, but enabling
Xdebug with cookies or adding POST/GET variables is way too hard. This extension will help you to enable/disable
debugging, profiling and tracing of your PHP-code easily.

How to install this extension?
------------------------------
**Stable version:**  Go to the [Safari Extension Gallery](https://extensions.apple.com) and look for "Xdebug Helper" in the "Developer" category.

**Development version:** [Download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/wrep/xdebug-helper-for-safari/archive/master.zip)
