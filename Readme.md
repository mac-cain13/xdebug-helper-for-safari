XDebug Helper for Safari
========================

Debugging, profiling and tracing PHP code with [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) is very powerful, but enabling
Xdebug with cookies or adding POST/GET variables is way too hard. This extension will help you to enable/disable
debugging, profiling and tracing of your PHP-code easily.

State of the extension
----------------------
We've just started development and the extension is not yet stable, also this Readme is far from incomplete.
Contributions are very welcome, but don't expect anything usable yet!
